The Vehicle Rental System is a full-stack web application built using the PERN stack â€” PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It is designed to automate and simplify the process of renting vehicles online, providing a user-friendly platform for both customers and administrators.

Users can browse through available vehicles, view details, make bookings, and manage their reservations with ease. The system includes user authentication and secure session handling to ensure data privacy and account integrity. On the admin side, authorized users can add, update, or remove vehicle listings, view bookings, and manage overall rental operations efficiently.

The frontend is developed with React.js, offering a responsive and dynamic user interface. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, handling API requests and core business logic. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which supports efficient queries and relational data handling. RESTful APIs ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

This project demonstrates the practical application of modern web development technologies in building a scalable and maintainable rental management system.
